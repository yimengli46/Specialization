1. create soft link for the data
$ ln -s /home/yimeng/Datasets/habitat-lab/data habitat_data

2. run tools/analyze.py to analyze mp3d pointnav episodes.

3. save scene_floor_dict.npy as
npy[scene][floor], each floor has two keys y and a list of nodes.

train episode data is different from val and test.
In train data, each scene has 80K episodes.


4. First build semantic maps
then build occupancy maps
